I am a second rate musician and someone who programs. I am currently the Digital Development technician for Edinburgh College of art. I help staff and students out with programming, a little electronics and generally getting their heads round how to do things. Anyone can program and all programming is just workflow. I hope to demonstrate that in this blog.
