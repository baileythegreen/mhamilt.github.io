I am a second rate musician and someone who programs in C++, python and Java (if under duress). I am currently employed as the Digital Development Technician for the Edinburgh College of Art. My role is to help staff and students with programming projects, a little electronics and generally getting their heads round how to do things.

Anyone can program and all programming is just workflow. I hope to demonstrate that in this blog.
