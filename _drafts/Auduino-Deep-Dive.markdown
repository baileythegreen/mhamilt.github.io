<p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span></p>he Auduino Code originally by Peter Knight has been kicking around for me than 10 years now.

Still strugggle to understand all the elements. In its final form, it is a little verbose. Handy that it is in one sketch but this has become bloated over time.

This is part in a series of taking apart the code, discussing some of the approaches taken and painting over some uglier things with a fresh coat of code.
